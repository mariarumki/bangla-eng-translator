# bangla-eng-translator

We utilized Flask to develop an online translator from Bengali to English, which takes a Bengali sentence as input and generates its English translation automatically. To accomplish this task, we relied on the "ben-eng" dataset, sourced from http://www.manythings.org/anki/, and implemented an encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism. Subsequently, we built the frontend of the web application using html and css. We also created a "requirements.txt" file that lists all the essential libraries and wrote a "main.py" file to implement Flask and integrate the necessary functions into the application.

A few screenshots from the web application are attached below:
